These are more recent paintings used with an updated iPad app. I experimented with a stylus, but ultimately decided that it was too restrictive, opting for zooming in to get the precision that I wanted.

### A City Scene

While having dinner on Castro Street in Mountain View, the scene was busy and fun. This scene took roughly 4 days to paint, on and off. During the painting, I experimented with layering, ultimately buying the Sketches app.

### 1970s Police

Reminiscent of Stephen King book covers, I tried to make this one an inexplicably darker picture, where something about this picture is ironically unsettling.

### The Iconic Castle

This is essentially copied from the Disney Castle before movies. The lighting on the castle was especially difficult.
