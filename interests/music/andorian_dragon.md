# The Andorian Dragon
## How He Helped Me Find You

V1
I hiked through the valley of the Andorian Dragon  
He looked through my heart, as he slowly spoke to me  
Friend, your cause is worthy, just start to imagine  
The face, her smile, a mystery in your dream   

V2
So I swam through the waters of the Elysian sea  
When I couldn't swim any further, the Dragon came to me  
Friend, take heart, and the Angels shall appear  
They'll lift your spirits, and drive away that fear  

Pre-C
Not giving up (am, E), I'm not giving in (FM)  
I'm fighting until the day (CM), Till I can find a way (GM)

C
So I travel the world (CM, G)
just to catch a glimpse (FM, G)
of what it's like (CM, G)
to remember that bliss (GM, D)

But I never could find,  
as I've lost my damn mind  
a moment that felt right  
like when you were in my life  

V3
Weary traveler, said the dragon, I'll be your friend  
For as long as you need, and maybe that's the end
But please for now, have some rest  
We'll start again tomorrow, tonight you're my guest  

V4
So I took a load off, I closed my eyes
As I waited for the sandman to take me away
But all I could see was you in the skies
Our fingers touched and you told me to stay

C
So I climbed every tree
and I scaled every cliff
Until I got lost and 
my ship floated adrift

But I never could find,
as I've lost my damn mind  
a moment that felt right  
like when you were in my life
