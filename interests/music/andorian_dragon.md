# The Andorian Dragon
## How He Helped Me Find You

V1
I walked through the valley of the Andorian Dragon 
He looked through my heart, as he slowly spoke to me 
Friend, your cause is worthy, just start to imagine 
Her face, her smile, the mystery of your dream

V2
So I swam through the waters of the Elysian sea 
When I couldn't swim any further, the Dragon came to me
Friend, take heart, and the Angels shall appear
They'll lift your spirits, and drove away that fear

Pre-C
Not giving up (am, E), I'm not giving in (FM)
I'm fighting until the day (CM), Till I can find a way (GM)

C
And I traveled the world (CM, G)
just to catch a glimpse (FM, G)
of what it's like (CM, G)
to remember that bliss (GM, D)

But I never could find,
as I've lost my damn mind
a momen that felt right
when you were in my life

V3
Weary traveler, said the dragon, I'll be your friend
For as long as you need, and maybe that's the end
But please, have some rest
