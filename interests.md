### Climbing

#### Grizzly Peak Bouldering

Check out the climbing map for the [exact coordinates](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zLHKHr8srqkI.kpkaPD1cy8NM). Parking is prohibited where the Subaru currently is (below) from April to mid-November, but during the winter time, you can. But, that little pull off is what we use to identify where this sucka is, and the pointy arrow (in the second image below) is where we walked up. The view of the pull (from the Subaru's perspective) is in the third image below, and the pathway is to the right (as in the video.)
