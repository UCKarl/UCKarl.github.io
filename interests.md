### Food <a name="Food"></a> 

Cold smoking salmon. "Sushi-grade" salmon, doesn't really exist. Before you do anything with the . There are several ways to do it:

1. Liquid smoke (cheating, really)
2. Low heat, coal grill-based
3. Side smoker
4. Traeger grill

### Climbing <a name="Climbing"></a> 

Check out the climbing map for the [exact coordinates](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zLHKHr8srqkI.kpkaPD1cy8NM) of several East Bay bouldering areas. On the peninsula, I've found this guy's [website](http://web.stanford.edu/~clint/) and his linked [map](http://web.stanford.edu/~clint/ba/) to be helpful.

### Grizzly Peak Bouldering

One of the more difficult places to find. Copy the link below onto your phone's GPS so that you can find the climbing area.

Parking is prohibited where the Subaru currently is (below) from April to mid-November, but during the winter time, you can pull in. That little pull off is what we use to identify where this sucka is, and the pointy arrow (in the first image below) is where you can walk up to the rocks without running into poison ivy. The pathway is just to the left of the car.

Once you're there, you'll get to see a variety of rocks and some interesting problems.
