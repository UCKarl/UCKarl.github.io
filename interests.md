### Food  

**Cold smoking salmon**

1. _Buying the salmon_: "Sushi-grade" salmon, doesn't really exist. It really depends on where you get your fish. 

   First off, since salmon can be a freshwater fish, it is always frozen before anyone cooks it. Then, when you go to CostCo, you're getting. 

2. _Freezing the fish_:   To be safe, though, before you do anything with the salmon, freeze it. The particular strain of bacteria that you're trying to get rid of is. There are several ways to do it:

3. _Preparing and flavoring_:  There are actually only a few essential ingredients that you need for preparation and the rest is optional. I've made it bare and with additional stuff, and unless your palate is very sensitive, the hint of dill or the extra stuff are nice, but not necessary to the basic 

4. _Cold smoking, various methodologies_:

     1. Liquid smoke (cheating, really)
     2. Low heat, coal grill-based
     3. Side smoker
     4. Traeger grill

### Climbing  

Check out the climbing map for the [exact coordinates](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zLHKHr8srqkI.kpkaPD1cy8NM) of several East Bay bouldering areas. On the peninsula, I've found this guy's [website](http://web.stanford.edu/~clint/) and his linked [map](http://web.stanford.edu/~clint/ba/) to be helpful.

### Grizzly Peak Bouldering

One of the more difficult places to find. Copy the link below onto your phone's GPS so that you can find the climbing area.

Parking is prohibited where the Subaru currently is (below) from April to mid-November, but during the winter time, you can pull in. That little pull off is what we use to identify where this sucka is, and the pointy arrow (in the first image below) is where you can walk up to the rocks without running into poison ivy. The pathway is just to the left of the car.

Once you're there, you'll get to see a variety of rocks and some interesting problems.
