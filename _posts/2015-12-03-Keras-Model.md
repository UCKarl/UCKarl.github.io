Three weeks before I met you, during my first winter in Boston, I had just moved. One of the few things I looked forward to was when Emily would come. (I didn't know it, but it'd also be a fateful NYBFF introduction!) The other thing I had to look forward to was flying home for Christmas. A third thing I was excited about....well....was nothing....

MIT-LL had me on RADAR calibration at that time, which is done by pointing the scope towards known star constellations. Needless to say, that meant I had to stay at work pretty late in order to catch the night time stars. The guy who I sat next to was a die-hard astronomer-aspirant, and he would talk my ear off. I actually wasn't all that interested, and so I'd nod and smile, hoping he'd stop talking to me. Add to that, coming home in the dark late at night (especially when the guy wouldn't stop talking), only to have to get up early the next day. Every night driving home, I was pretty tired, and the roads were icy.

The specific event I remember begins by not being able to park near my apartment because the snow bank was too high. This was all at around 1AM. My XTerra, which had seen more salt than ever before, made the rounds looking for non-towing areas. After parking far from my apartment, slipping on the ice a couple of times, I stepped in some fresh snow ... with tennis shoes. I didn't at the time, but I can almost hear myself say, "F this noise, I'm out. First thing tomorrow!"

So, imagine your first time truly away in a city with no friends. Remember being colder than you've ever been in your life and double that. Then, let's say that someone you've dated for forever is now seeing someone else; this you learned via Facebook. And then, try to feel the snow slowly melt to soak into your socks...the wetness seeping around your feet, the cold permeating to your toes, which are numb already.

But all of a sudden, look up! ...and this is one of the only memories I have of that time. The moon: it was large and round. Not only that it was white! Not yellowish, not off-white, but bright fluorescent white (if there is such a color.) The sky had a dark blue tint surrounding it, and the branches of the bare trees reached up to grab at it, poking holes into the moon's craters. Snow was still lightly falling, and the reflection made parts of it seem like particles coming off the moonlight. A beautiful night. 

Things seemed to slow down, and even now, all I can remember is the image in my mind, probably more glorious than it actually was. All that other stuff, so trivial; so small. This one moment, I'll remember. And I miss it now.

If you take your entire life and try to describe it...what defines it, you're left with little moments like these. Inflection points. Life's chapter markers, or at the very least, summaries of swaths of time painted to be more splendid than reality. Without moments like these, your life isn't about memories...it's about history. And that's less interesting.

For me, the history that followed was about making new friends, old friends moving in, I met you. I had ups and downs, mostly feeling the ups afterwards, the downs during. But before that: the memory of a moon that filled half the sky, of a starless blue sky with snowflakes floating down, and of me and my white breath into the night, smiling.
