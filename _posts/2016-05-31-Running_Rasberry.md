Y'know I always remember the time when you cried  
the tears streaming down your big brown eyes  
I just smiled and leaned down to kiss it away  
sayin', ssh shh, darlin' it'll be okay

When you went to off to school, I slowly sighed  
but a boy brought you back home to my arms  
I was just glad that you had me to confide,  
sayin', shh shh, darlin', here's a hug.  

Oh, it was just a ras-berry  
from you running too fast  
You soon forgot it quickly  
But I remember like days past
