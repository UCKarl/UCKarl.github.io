The following is work done at Lab41, though initially started at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

By now you've heard of the [YFCC 100M Dataset](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=i&did=67), and you may even have played around with the dataset. You'll start to notice that the metadata tags aren't very descriptive of the images themselves for most of the images. For example, take the below.

### Word2Vec

One of the more impactful papers in the past few years is Tomas Mikolov's word2vec.

#### The Trouble with GPUs

Mikolov's work is all done on multi-threaded CPUs, with good reason. The motherboard simply has way more memory. Secondly, he deals with only wide neural networks, which means that optimizing a single layer in parallel may be just fine. It's analogous to HOG-Wild, where you're just randomly optimizing columns.
