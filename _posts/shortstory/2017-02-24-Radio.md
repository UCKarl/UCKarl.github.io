...or rather, the world itself is different slightly...in that it is an entirely different world, Sorry, let me back up. My name's Jake, and I am, I think, a first year graduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying quantum mechanics. 

Why the "I think" you ask. Right, well, I inherited a radio on my 23rd birthday was tuned to 93.1 when I got it with the note:

> > Understanding is the journey to knowledge. To most, it is unattainable because it lies behind closed doors. This is your key. Enjoy your journey.
> > 
> > Love,
> > Pop-Pop.

I thought nothing of it until a few days later when I turned the channel a couple of notches to the right. I didn't notice anything different at first. No music. the thing is busted. Shrug. I just started doing some homework.
