Part of a create writing exercise, where we must come up with a poem/story beginning with "I come from..."

## I come from ...

...the depths of your mind, just before you drift away, as your consciousness slips from your grasp. I await...calmly and ready to embrace.

You never remember me, but every night I reach out and ask where you'd like to venture. And some lurid nights, when dreams turn perilous, I whisk you back to lucidness, oftentimes too hard by whiplashing you to sit up, out of breath.

My name? I have many. My favorite arises because I materialize when I appear, and diseintegrate when I leave, almost as though each molecule of my body shoots off in various directions...a man of sand for those who can remember seeing me.

Tonight, where would you like to journey? What adventures shall we embark on? I can grant you flight; I can grant you unlimited breath...or maybe I'm in a humorous mood and strip away your clothing save your underwear lest you notice...always too late. It's just a joke, do not worry, I will gladly pull you back before you embarrass too much.

Under the sea? Atop a cavern on the moon? What's that? You would like to see a former lover? A glimpse? We have done this before. You know it ends poorly each night. Why again?

How about a castle rendezvous with a knight in medieval times? How about riding an air-cycle with a robot friend? No? Still you desire *that* dream?

Fine, then! I'll keep watch; I'll wake you soon...and know that I will be your *only* friend for this night.

He is together on the bench with someone. It is cold, and the autumn breazes blow leaves onto your face. The hair, so annoying in your mouth. Pfft, you blow them away.

You draw nearer, and you see his arm around her. She looks like you from behind. Her hair also blows in the wind. 

As you reach out to touch his shoulder, your doppelganger turns toward you. She has no face; eyeless and featureless. She has no face, yet, you know she is beautiful. She. has. no. face. You should be horrified. But that is not what you feel as there are tears of sadness welling instead. She is not you. Your ex-lover abruptly stands and with him, the faceless doppelganger stroll away hand-in-hand.

Enough. You have seen enough. It is time to leave. I'll take you home, even though you are alone in bed there and it is cold tonight. What's that? Of course, I'll stay a while and smile. But tomorrow night, it is my choice; I must insist on where to go.
