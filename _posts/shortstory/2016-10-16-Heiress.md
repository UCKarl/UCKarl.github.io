She stared down at her notes and then looked up at the crowd. Though not a stranger to crowds and the limelight, this was different. This was pressure; true pressure that she had earned. Amongst the onlookers, there were a few friends, but mostly there were news reporters. She thought to herself, "hmph, well I had always wanted attention", smiling. As she started to rifle through her notecards, flashes of her past grasped at the far reaches of her mind.

Venice Mariot was a unique girl, whose looks had gotten her far in life. But, to most, it was not her looks but her name. She was daughter of a wealthy hotel chain owner, and while interested in being a celebrity, she also wanted to prove her metal with intelligence as well. 

In high school, she was a fair student, A's and B's, but could've gone to any school. Her father, after all, was quick with his checkbook, but she chose a state school despite her mother looked on, dumbfounded. Her classmates knew who she was, of course; everyone knew who she was.

"No, Paris, I think I'll stay in tonight."

"Sorry Miley, I've got a big test tomorrow."

Despite shenanigans and the usual partying, undergrad was slightly boring for her, until she took that one class. That class that changed her: AI 101, and she was hooked; couldn't stop harping on how this would change the world. It was deep learning this, and support vector machines that.
