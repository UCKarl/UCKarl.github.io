She stared down at her notes and then looked up at the crowd. Though not a stranger to crowds and the limelight, this was different. This was pressure; true pressure that she had earned. Amongst the onlookers, there were a few friends, but mostly there were news reporters. She thought to herself, "hmph, well I had always wanted attention", smiling. As she started to rifle through her notecards, flashes of her past grasped at the far reaches of her mind.

Venice Mariot was a unique girl, whose looks had gotten her far in life. But, to most, it was not her looks but her name. She was daughter of a wealthy hotel chain owner, and while interested in being a celebrity, she also wanted to prove her metal with intelligence as well. 

In high school, she was a fair student, A's and B's, but could've gone to any school. Her father, after all, was quick with his checkbook, but she chose a state school despite her mother looked on, dumbfounded. Her classmates knew who she was, of course; everyone knew who she was.

"No, Paris, I think I'll stay in tonight."

"Sorry Miley, I've got a big test tomorrow."

Despite shenanigans and the usual partying, undergrad was slightly boring for her, until she took that one class. That class that changed her: AI 101, and she was hooked; couldn't stop harping on how this would change the world. It was deep learning this, and support vector machines that. This went on, publishing her first academic article as an undergraduate and pursuing a Ph.D., with her thesis being one of few professors actually read and passed around.

She initially started worrying about her association with money being the reason why she got attention. That was until one day at a conference, a Japanese student approached her. He was slightly awkward, making Venice look more skeptical.

"Great, I haven't been hit on in a while....since this morning," she thought.

But then he spoke, "Ah Mariot Miss Venice? Ah yes. Ah, I like your paper on ... robust fast 2nd moment approximation for gradients," as he bowed excessively. "Ah I always think Advisor Clem is very famous to get good research papers."

At first she couldn't explain it. Was it that he liked my work? Is that why she felt relieved? But as time wore on, she started to realize, it was that last sentence...*Advisor Clem* is very famous. He had no idea who she was. The daughter of the great George Mariot got acknolwedged for her contributions and not her name.


Back at the podium, she looked up from her note cards, and took a breath, slowly. She'd done well to get to where she was. And, then Chris Wallace, the moderator for the 3rd debate for the office of the president, called her name to the stage to battle her opponent.
