She stared down at her notes and then looked up at the crowd. Though not a stranger to crowds and the limelight, this was different. This was pressure; true pressure that she had earned. Amongst the onlookers, there were a few friends, but mostly there were news reporters. She thought to herself, "hmph, well I had always wanted attention", smiling. As she started to rifle through her notecards, flashes of her past grasped at the far reaches of her mind.

Venice Mariot was a unique girl, whose looks had gotten her far in life. But, to most, it was not her looks but her name. She was daughter of a wealthy hotel chain owner, and while interested in being a celebrity, she also wanted to prove her metal with intelligence as well. 

In high school, she was a fair student, A's and B's, but could've gone to any school. Her father, after all, was quick with his checkbook, but she chose a state school despite her mother looked on, dumbfounded. Her classmates knew who she was, of course; everyone knew who she was. On Friday night, her phone would ring, and they'd hear:

"No, Paris, I think I'll stay in tonight."

"Sorry Miley, I've got a big test tomorrow."

Despite shenanigans and the usual partying, undergrad was slightly boring for her, until she took that one class. That class that forever caused her eyes to light up: Machine Learning 101. She was hooked, and she let the world know about it. It was deep learning this, and support vector machines that. This went on, publishing her first academic article as an undergraduate and pursuing a Ph.D., with her thesis being one of few professors actually read and passed around.

She initially started worrying about her association with money being the reason why she got attention. That was until one day at a conference, a Japanese student approached her. He was slightly awkward, making Venice look more skeptical.

"Great, I haven't been hit on in a while....well, I guess there was that thing this morning...," she thought.

But then he spoke, "Ah Mariot Miss Venice? Ah yes. Ah, I like read your paper on ... robust fast 2nd moment approximation for gradients," as he bowed excessively. "Ah I always think Advisor Clem is very famous to get good research papers."

At first she couldn't explain why she suddenly felt relieved. Was it that he liked my work? But a few moments after addressing his questions, she started to realize that it was that last interaction when he introduced himself: *Advisor Clem is very famous*. That was it; he had no idea who she was. The daughter of the great George Mariot got acknowledged, perhaps for the first unequivocal time, for her contributions and not for the name Mariot.

After graduation, she received offers, but decided against the larger companies that swept talent up through the weight of their money. She knew the draw of money well and had become to resent it as she grew estranged from her family. Her friends now, most of whom did not realize her connection to her more famous counterparts (many of whom had become pop stars, and some of whom were scandalized with sextapes), had thought her peers from her prior life to be from another world, one they would never, or more to the point, *could* never gain admission to.

Back at the podium, she looked up from her note cards, and took a breath, slowly. She'd worked hard to get to where she was, something unexpected of many from her echelon. Just then, the moderator, Chris Wallace, called her opponent to the stage, an equally famous brand, though his rise engendered from reality TV and real estate. Her heart skipped beats as he waved at the crowd. And then...just then, she heard her name announced as she stepped out from behind the curtains. She was ready for the 3rd debate for the most unconventional campaign season ever to have graced the United States landscape,
