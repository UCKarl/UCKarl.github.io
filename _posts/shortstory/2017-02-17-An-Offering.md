I felt the hand of the officer softly, yet forcefully push my head down as I ducked into the back of the squad car. While doing so, my throat had neglected to follow me and had thus risen to my throat. Yes, that was my throat, the body partthat could use about a gallon of water right now. As I sat, red and blue lights struck the rear window and onto the back of my head while my heart battered my ribcage.

The radio cackled with intermittent and almost unintelligible chatter, not that I could comprehend what was being said anyway. How would I get myself out of it this time? I closed my eyes, and started to count to ten slowly. One. Two. Three. Four...

A click and a creak interrupted my meditation routine, and the white noise of wind and a crowd filled the cabin of the Crown Victoria while a young officer climbed in. Another click and a creak, and now double the noise. The other officer, an older and smellier officer dropped in. Smoke filled the cabin. Or was that putrid smell my imagination? 

"You alright back there?" asked the younger officer in the passenger seat.

Someone responded, "No." I realized that someone was me. That raspy voice was mine.

"Good," the older officer goaded.

Years later, I would look back on today and still not be able to recall their names. Let's say the younger officer was called Johnny and the veteran one, Everett. The two intimated an unlikely Training Day-eque combination, but neither seemed interested in my comfort nor my well-being at the moment.

The car started towards . We entered the freeway, and immediately encountered traffic. For twenty minutes, enough time for my thoughts to start lucidly forming, albeit slowly.

"Can I have my cellphone?" I asked.

"Nope," Everett responded matter-of-factly.

I slowly started to accept my fate, and I sank lower into my seat.

"I need to reach my wife and daughter," I explained. And after a pause, "Please."

"Not interested."

"You should have thought of that before you shot that guy."

And then, . It wasn't that I was denied my cellphone; I expected that. It wasn't that he had authority over that decision. It wasn't the matter-of-fact way in which he threw those words out of his mouth, the carelessness. And then, my heart-rate increased. This time was different, though. Instead of the cold agony of uncertainty, I felt a hot rush flow through my arteries and get sucked up through my veins.

"Look, you don't know me. You don't know why I did what I did. And even if you did, you don't know who I did it to. All you know is some guy. Maybe it was as simple as this guy . Or maybe it was because this guy murdered."

"Look buddy..."

"Wait, I'm not done yet. Yeah, I know judgement when I see it. I saw it on the faces of Afghan mothers I had to ask for information. I saw it on my buddy's wife when I collected my purple heart while she collected her husband's body

Silence.

"Yeah, that sucks," the Johnny admitted. 

And then, a moment that I would later realize would the most important moment in my life, the older officer then, ever so softly, offered, "I'm sorry." There were two ways.

Maybe I'll make it through today after all, I thought.
