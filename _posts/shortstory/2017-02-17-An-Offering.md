I felt the hand of the officer forcefully push my head down as I ducked into the back of the squad car. While doing so, my throat had neglected to follow me and had thus risen to my throat. Yes, that was my throat, the body partthat could use about a gallon of water right now. As I sat, red and blue lights struck the rear window and onto the back of my head while my heart battered my ribcage.

The radio cackled with intermittent and almost unintelligible chatter, not that I could comprehend what was being said anyway. How would I get myself out of it this time? I closed my eyes, and started to count to ten slowly. One. Two. Three. Four...

A click and a creak interrupted my meditation routine, and the white noise of wind and a crowd filled the cabin of the Crown Victoria while a young officer, Officer Johnny, climbed in. (I don't remember his real name.) Another click and a creak, and now double the noise. The other officer, an older and more grizzled officer dropped in along with the smell of cigarettes. Let's call him Officer Everett. It was all very Training Day-esque.

"You alright back there?" asked the younger officer in the passenger seat.

A raspy voice responded, "No." I realized that the voice belonged to me.

"Good," the older officer goaded.

The car accelerated away from MLK Blvd. We climbed the onramp to the freeway and promptly encountered traffic. I noticed the clock on the car radio clock about twenty minutes later, at which time my thoughts started becoming more lucid and my head cleared.

"Can I have my cellphone?" I asked.

"Nope," Everett responded matter-of-factly.

I slowly started to accept my fate, and I sank lower into my seat.

"I need to reach my wife and daughter," I explained. And after a pause, "Please."

"Not interested."

Stop and go. My anxiety. After a few minutes, 

"Yeah, you want your cellphone, huh. I don't get you types, man. You should have thought of all of this before you neglected to pay your rent," Everett asserted.

And then my face and ears started to tingle. It wasn't that I was denied my cellphone; I expected that. It wasn't that he had authority over my fate and what I could and couldn't have or do. It was the casual indifference, the subtle judgement that I should have known better, the careless dismissal of the person rather than the request itself. That is when my heart-rate cranked up from a hundred beats per minute to a thousand beats per second. The cold cavity of uncertainty started to fill with a hot rush of blood flowing through my arteries that got sucked up through my veins.

"You types? Look, you don't know me. You don't know why I did what I did. And even if you did, you don't know who I did it to. All you know is some guy wouldn't leave his shop and the landlord called the cops. Yeah, I could be the asshole here, but maybe it's him."

"Look buddy..."

"Wait, I'm not done yet. Threatening my landlord might've been a bad decision. I've made plenty of those. But maybe I've done worse, and maybe I know a bit more about judgement than you do. Because maybe I saw it from my buddy's wife when I got my purple heart, and all she got was her husband's body. I've seen it from a stupid kid's mom when my captain ordered me to shoot him 'cause he had an IED. A kid not much older than the one who's waiting for his dad right now...and maybe that's why I need a phone."

Silence. My mind no longer raced. The flood gates had already released their load. The traffic lightened up as Officer Johnny's silhoette shielded the sun from my eyes. Officer Everett quietly wrote on a clipboard. It didn't matter, now. 

I was beginning to think that my anxiety was returning when I felt the belt tighten across my chest. Then I realized that the car was decelerating. A police station loomed over us. A complete stop. I opened my eyes, and Officer Johnny had left the car. Officer Everett was blankly staring at me. He had slipped my iPhone through the grating that separated the rear bench from the front.

"You got five minutes. Don't tell anyone."

I reached out for the phone and said, "Thank you."

"No, sir. Thank you."
