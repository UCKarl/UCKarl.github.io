I'm currently a research data scientist at [Lab41](http://lab41.org/) at
In-Q-Tel. My interests varied greatly throughout the years. I started research in image processing, focusing on denoising, super-resolution, and image mosaicking. Then, I looked into 3D multiview geometry from unstructured imagery and geolocating images using image features. Right now I'm working on Deep Learning, 
with an emphasis on Computer Vision.
