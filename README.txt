Sites to use as reference:
vdumoulin: I originally forked from him
https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites: Example sites using Jekyll
https://github.com/martinisoft/martinisoft.github.io: Taken from the above site. Looks awfully similar

Added and changed to template:
I added home-allposts.html. This is the original home.html, which posts all categories. Instead, I wanted to only post "article" categories from the _posts directory.
